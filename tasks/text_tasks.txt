	sigma(par1) ~ sR1 + sR2 + (sR1 * R1 + sR2 * R2) / (R1 + R2)
	sigma(par2) ~ (sR1 * R2 + sR2 * R1) / (R1 + R2)

	if R1 > 0, R2 > 0
	sigma(par1) > sigma(par2)

	That happens because of repetitions of R1 and R2 in par1 as
	different "measures".

	It is more correct here to estimate the error through
	partial derivatives d/dR1, d/dR2, so par2 is correct.

	Seems like it can be done by "naming" intervals and silently
	collecting them in one algebraic expression in data structure.
	Then we must find max(f(x1,x2,x3,...,xn)) on "interval"-
	closure in Rn. This is true rocket science.
